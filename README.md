# Assignment 2
It focuses on classification and linear classifiers. You will learn about logistic regression, and implement a linear clasifier baed on logistic regression. You will also extend the use of bais functions to classifications, and learn how they could help us tackle classification problems with non-linearily separable classes.

# Instructions
This script is meant as a guid for students to learn Python and do Assignment 2 of the course. It has more missing lines than those of previous assignment, so that students can be more independent when developing a code

Please note the following:
1) Data is ALREADY RANDOMLY SHUFFLED
2) DO NOT change the structure of the code. Just fill in the 
missing lines
3) FILL IN the missing lines in both "main.py" and "utils.py"
4) The script must type out the training record for each model.
5) Print validation loss of both models. 
6) Make sure the visualization section works. It must produce 
four figures.
